            <h5> Our mission statment </h5>
            <p>Our mission is to ignite a powerful movement within the Rochester, MN community—connecting families,
                educators, mentors, and youth through dynamic STEM opportunities that inspire curiosity, creativity, and
                confidence. We believe that every young mind deserves access to the tools and support to explore
                science, technology, engineering, and math—and we are especially committed to empowering girls to rise,
                lead, and thrive in spaces where their brilliance has too often been overlooked.

                Through this platform, we aim to break down barriers, spotlight local programs, and foster meaningful
                connections that nurture the next generation of innovators. Because the future of STEM is diverse,
                local, and unstoppable—and it begins right here, together.</p>
