            <h3> Our mission statment </h3>
            <p>Our mission is to ignite a powerful movement within the Rochester, MN communityâ€”connecting families,
                educators, mentors, and youth through dynamic STEM opportunities that inspire curiosity, creativity, and
                confidence. We believe that every young mind deserves access to the tools and support to explore
                science, technology, engineering, and mathâ€”and we are especially committed to empowering girls to rise,
                lead, and thrive in spaces where their brilliance has too often been overlooked.

                Through this platform, we aim to break down barriers, spotlight local programs, and foster meaningful
                connections that nurture the next generation of innovators. Because the future of STEM is diverse,
                local, and unstoppableâ€”and it begins right here, together.</p>

                <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
                <p>Grace Hopper was a groundbreaking computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral who helped pioneer
                    programming in the early days of computing. She developed the first compiler and played a major role
                    in creating COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. Known as "Amazing Grace," she
                    also popularized the term "debugging" after removing a moth from a computer. Her work opened doors
                    for women in tech and shaped the future of software development. ðŸŒŸ</p>

                <h3>Edith Clarke</h3>
                <p>Edith Clarke was a trailblazing electrical engineer and the first woman to earn an electrical
                    engineering degree from MIT. She made major contributions to power system analysis and invented the
                    Clarke Calculator, which simplified complex electrical calculations. In 1922, she became the first
                    professionally employed female electrical engineer in the U.S. Her work paved the way for women in
                    engineering and helped modernize the electric power industry. âš¡</p>
